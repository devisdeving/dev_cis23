    <h2>Kuhu Juneja</h2>

<div class="text">
    <p>Every day is a new beginning, and there is no real end. Life is a continuous cycle of moments, each one building upon the last and leading to the next. As I sit down to write this personal narrative, I am reminded of this truth. I want this memoir to have a homely and warm feel, like a hug from an old friend.</p>

<div class="text">
    <p>It is a "memo intertwined between beginnings and endings, poetry and prose." I want to tell my story in a way that captures the essence of my experiences. Handwritten elements will speak to the core of my memories, drawing attention to the moments that have shaped me.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <p>All memories are not linear and don't follow a chronological order. They are all important, and all text applies equally to all images. To emphasize this, I will push the images to the left, allowing the majority of the width to be white space. This draws attention to the content and weight of these memories.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Through this personal narrative, I hope to share a piece of myself with the world. Life is a beautiful and complex journey, and I want to capture its essence in all its glory. This is my story, and I am excited to share it with you.</p>
