          <p>I was intrigued by them not using a "nav" element to code the nav-bar, even though it might just be for semantic reasons, it was an interesting choice that they just used 'a' tags throughout</p>
          <p>I was quite intimidated by the fancy JS stuff going on with the hero section of the Landing Page, but just figured it was a .json animation and the frames were reacting to mouse accelerations, would love to learn how to recreate that</p>
          <p>The strucure was quite straight forward, alot of nested and wrapped divs, but alot of untidiness but I'd like to understand why it is that way, but at first glance, difficult to look at</p>

          I was very fascinated by seeing a "custom html" tag inside the html, wondering what it's about, and what aditional purpose it serves
