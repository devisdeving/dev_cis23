            <p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. 
                Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered 
                with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or 
                pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the first 
                trivial and the second almost incredible: the music 
                came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. 
                That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying 
                it any attention. I do not remember whether there was 
                a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention
                 by clapping my hands. The stuttering sparks of the 
                 music kept on.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, 
                a lantern approached; a lantern which alternately, 
                from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out 
                by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped 
                like a drum and colored like the moon. A tall man 
                carried it. I could not see his face for the light 
                blinded me.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.</p>
            <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself 
                to see to relieving my solitude. 
                No doubt you want to see the garden?"</p>
            <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, 
                I replied, somewhat taken aback.</p>
            <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"The garden?"
                <br><br><br><br>
                "The garden of forking paths."
            </p>
            <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Something stirred in my memory and I said, 
                with incomprehensible assurance:</p>
            <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."
                <br><br>
                "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."</p>
                    <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. 
                When we reached the house, we went into a library 
                filled with books from both East and West. I 
                recognized some large volumes bound in yellow 
                silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which 
                was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. 
                They had never been printed. A phonograph record was 
                spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also a 
                rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many 
                centuries, of that blue color which our potters 
                copied from the Persians...</p>
                 <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
                 <p>We sat down, I upon a large, low divan,
                     he with his back to the window and to a 
                     large circular clock. I calculated that my 
                     pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in 
                     less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait.</p>
                <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
                    <p>"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, 
                        "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native 
                        province, learned in astronomy, in astrology 
                        and tireless in the interpretation of the 
                        canonical books, a chess player, a famous 
                        poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned 
                        all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave 
                        up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, 
                        of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even 
                        of erudition, and shut himself up in the 
                        Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen 
                        years. At his death, his heirs found only
                         a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you 
                         doubtless know, wished to consign them to 
                         the fire, but the executor of the estate - 
                         a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on 
                         their publication."</p>
                         <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
                         <p>"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, 
                            "still curse the memory of that monk. Such 
                            a publication was madness. The book is a 
                            shapeless mass of contradictory rough 
                            drafts. I examined it once upon a time: 
                            the hero dies in the third chapter, while 
                            in the fourth he is alive. As for that 
                            other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his 
                            Labyrinth..."</p>

            <p>With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, 
                although perhaps with less admiration for them in 
                themselves than for the fact that they had been 
                thought out by one of my own blood, and that a 
                man of a distant empire had given them back to 
                me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, 
                on a Western island. I remember the final words, 
                repeated at the end of each version like a secret 
                command: "Thus the heroes fought, with tranquil 
                heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to 
                killing and to dying."</p>

                <p>At that moment I felt within me and around 
                    me something invisible and intangible pullulating. 
                    It was not the pullulation of two divergent, 
                    parallel, and finally converging armies, but 
                    an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, 
                    prefigured by them in some way. Stephen Albert 
                    continued:</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor 
                    toyed idly with variations. I do not find it 
                    believable that he would waste thirteen years 
                    laboring over a never ending experiment in 
                    rhetoric. In your country the novel is an 
                    inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it 
                    was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine 
                    novelist but he was also a man of letters 
                    who, doubtless, considered himself more than 
                    a mere novelist. The testimony of his 
                    contemporaries attests to this, and 
                    certainly the known facts of his life 
                    confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical 
                    and the mystical.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>Philosophical conjectures take up the greater 
                    part of his novel. I know that of all problems, 
                    none disquieted him more, and none concerned him 
                    more than the profound one of time. Now then, 
                    this is the only problem that does not figure 
                    in the pages of The Garden. He does not even 
                    use the word which means time.</p>

                <p>How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"</p>
