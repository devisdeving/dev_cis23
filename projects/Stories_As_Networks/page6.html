            <p>"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, 
                laquered writing cabinet.
                <br><br>
                "An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed...!"
                </p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible 
                labyrinth of time. I, a barbarous Englishman, 
                have been given the key to this transparent mystery. 
                After more than a hundred years most of the details 
                are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn't 
                hard to image what must have happened. At one time, 
                Ts'ui Pen must have said; 'I am going into seclusion 
                to write a book,' and at another, 'I am retiring to 
                construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate 
                activities. No one realized that the book and the 
                labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of the 
                Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. 
                This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged 
                to your family, no one could find the labyrinth. The novel's 
                confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. 
                First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create 
                an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which 
                I discovered."</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. 
                He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded 
                writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a piece 
                of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded 
                with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, 
                quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. 
                Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which 
                a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: "I 
                leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden 
                of forking paths."</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on:</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a 
                book could be infinite. I could not imagine any other than 
                a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page would 
                be the same as the first and so have the possibility of 
                continuing indefinitely. I recalled, too, the night in 
                the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen 
                Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of 
                her copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand 
                and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the 
                night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to 
                infinity. I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, 
                passed on from father to son, to which each individual 
                would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, 
                the work of his elders.</p>
            <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
            <p>"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed 
                to have the remotest application to the contradictory 
                chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At this point, I was sent from 
                Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.</p>

            <p>"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I 
                leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden 
                of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I 
                understood. The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic 
                novel itself. The phrase 'to various future times, but 
                not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, 
                not in space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this 
                theory. In all fiction, when a man is faced with 
                alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the 
                others. In the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he 
                chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus 
                creates various futures, various times which start 
                others that will in their turn branch out and 
                bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of 
                the contradictions in the novel.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>"Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks 
                    at his door. Fang makes up his mind to kill him. 
                    Naturally there are various possible outcomes. Fang 
                    can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, 
                    both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. 
                    In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, 
                    each one being the point of departure for other 
                    bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth 
                    converge. For example, you come to this house; but in 
                    other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my 
                    friend.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, 
                    I would like to read you a few pages of your ancestor's work."</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was 
                    certainly that of an ancient, but it shone with 
                    something unyielding, even immortal.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. 
                    In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain 
                    pass. The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the s
                    oldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so they 
                    won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through 
                    a palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast 
                    remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory 
                    followed.</p>
