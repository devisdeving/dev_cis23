            <p>Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the 
                seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject 
                happiness. I told myself that the duel had already started 
                and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary
                 in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - 
                 by an accident of fate. I argued that so small a victory 
                 prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so 
                 trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of 
                 the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, 
                 with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof 
                 that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful 
                 conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never 
                 left me.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new 
                abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will 
                be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would 
                undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it 
                were already accomplished, should impose upon himself
                a future as irrevocable as
                the past.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already 
                dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which 
                would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse coming 
                of night.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed 
                down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. No one 
                called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some 
                children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. 
                I got out.</p>
                <img src="page-6-clouds.png" class="clouds-opp">
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained 
                in a shadow. One of them asked me: "Are you going to Dr. 
                Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my answer, 
                another said: "The house is a good distance away but you 
                won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear 
                to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a coin (my 
                last), went down some stone steps and started along a 
                deserted road. At a slight incline, the road ran downhill. 
                It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of trees 
                intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if 
                to keep me company.</p>
            <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some 
                way have divined my desperate intent. At once I realized 
                that this would be impossible. The advice about turning 
                always to the left reminded me that such was the common 
                formula for finding the central courtyard of certain 
                labyrinths. I know something about labyrinths. Not for 
                nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was 
                Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write 
                a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung 
                Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would 
                lose themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly 
                assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger. 
                His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his 
                labyrinth.</p>
            <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and 
                perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and 
                perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined 
                it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I 
                imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions 
                and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and 
                kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, 
                ever growing maze which would take in both past and future 
                and would somehow involve the stars.</p>
                    <div class="medium-gap-div"></div>
            <p>Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - 
                that of the hunted. For an undetermined period of time 
                I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator. 
                The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of 
                the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping
                 road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once 
                 intimate and infinite.</p>
                 <div class="small-gap-div"></div>
                 <p>The road kept descending and branching off, 
                    through meadows misty in the twilight. A 
                    high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept 
                    coming and going, moving with the breeze, 
                    blurred by the leaves and by distance.</p>
                <div class="medium-gap-div">

                    <p>I thought that a man might be an enemy 
                        of other men, of the differing moments 
                        of other men, but never an enemy of a 
                        country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, 
                        streams, or the West wind.</p>

            <p>I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. 
                We discussed them. Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a 
                guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word 
                is the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and 
                then replied:</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div">
                    <img src="page-6-clouds.png" class="clouds-opp">
                    <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/1231630/stars.png" id="stars">
                </div>
                <p>"The word is chess."
                    <br><br>
                    "Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking 
                    Paths is an enormous guessing game, or parable, in 
                    which the subject is time. The rules of the game 
                    forbid the use of the word itself. To eliminate a 
                    word completely, to refer to it by means of inept 
                    phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best 
                    way of drawing attention to it. This, then, is the 
                    tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique 
                    Ts'ui Pen in every meandering of his interminable 
                    novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I 
                    have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, 
                    I have worked out the plan from this chaos, I have 
                    restored, or believe I have restored, the original. 
                    I have translated the whole work. I can state 
                    categorically that not once has the word time been 
                    used in the whole book.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>"The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking 
                    Paths is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of 
                    the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. 
                    Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor 
                    did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He 
                    believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily 
                    growing, ever spreading network of diverging, 
                    converging and parallel times. This web of time - 
                    the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, 
                    intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - 
                    embraces every possibility. We do not exist in 
                    most of them.</p>

                <p>In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, 
                    and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. 
                    In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have 
                    come to my gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, 
                    have found me dead. In yet another, I say these very 
                    same words, but am an error, a phantom."</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>"In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my 
                    voice. "I deeply appreciate and am grateful to you 
                    for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                    <p>"Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time 
                        is forever dividing itself toward innumerable 
                        futures and in one of them I am your enemy."</p>
