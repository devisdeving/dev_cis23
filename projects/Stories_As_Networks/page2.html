            <p>... and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German.
                 It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - 
                 though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there 
                 meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. 
                 Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An Irishman in the service 
                 of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and 
                 seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of 
                 Imperial Germany?</p>

            <p>Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century follows century, and things happen 
                only in the present. There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens 
                to me... The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.</p>

            <p>at once. I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. 
                    Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
                    Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the 
                    riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun.</p>
                <div class="large-gap-div"></div>
                <p>The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, 
                    with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, and that 
                    I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He does not know, for no 
                    one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</p>
