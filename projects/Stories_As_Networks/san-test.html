            <p>Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, 
                precisely now. Century follows century, and things happen 
                only in the present. There are countless men in the air, 
                on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to 
                me... The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface 
                put an end to these wandering thoughts.</p>
            <p>In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer 
                matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted 
                Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for the hangman's 
                noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier 
                did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the 
                exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. 
                A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I turned 
                it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the 
                skies of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain 
                of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by 
                a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could 
                be heard in Germany... My voice, my human voice, was weak. 
                How could it reach the ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick 
                and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except 
                that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his arid 
                Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking 
                in vain for news from us. I said aloud, "I must flee."</p>
            <p>I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if 
                Madden was already peering at me. Something - perhaps merely 
                a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty 
                out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. 
                The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, 
                the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's 
                office, the notebook, a letter which I decided to destroy at once 
                (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single 
                shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief 
                - and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and 
                weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought 
                that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</p>
            <p>In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory 
                gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the 
                information. He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an
                 hour away by train.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought 
                my incredibly risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, 
                and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for 
                Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, 
                particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. 
                Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, 
                is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an 
                hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.</p>
            <p>I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of 
                those of my race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination 
                lies in me. I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could save 
                his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His hands and 
                voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.Â 
                <br>
                <br>
                Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down 
                the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. The 
                station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent 
                to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being 
                recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely 
                visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop 
                short of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.</p>
            <p>I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station 
                further on. The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. 
                I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. There was 
                almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages. I 
                remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep 
                in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</p>
            <p>At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, 
                but vainly, the length of the platform.</p>
            <p>It was Captain Richard Madden.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. 
                It seemed to me that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was 
                infinitely saturated with invisible people. All were Albert and 
                myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. 
                I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the black 
                and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as
                 strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he 
                 was Captain Richard Madden.</p>
                <p>"The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can 
                    I take another look at the letter?"</p>
                <p>Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top 
                    drawer of the high writing cabinet. For a moment his back was 
                    again turned to me.</p>
                <p>I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care:</p>
                <p>Albert fell without a murmur,</p>
